   TOTAL 10 points
   This class is meant to model an item on an invoice.
   The code below compiles but is missing critical parts that you need to write. 
   Look for the TASK tags to tell you what you need to write.
   You may work on these tasks in a different order but they are numbered
   so as to provide you with a logical order to follow.

   /* TASK #1 - 1 point
      Declare the following attributes as private:
         name              of data type   String
         description       of data type   String
         quantity          of data type   int
         unitPrice         of data type   double

   /* TASK #2 - 2 point
      Write the code for the following constructor.
      In addition to initializing the attributes with their corresponding parameters,
      you will also need to create a new object of class Date and assign its reference
      to the dateRegistered attribute in order to time-stamp the object creation.
      Do not alter the name of the parameters.

      Write the code for the following no-args constructor.
      The default value must be as follows;

         string "..." for the description
         quantity of 0
         unitPrice of 0.0
      The dateRegistered attribute is expected to be set to the
      current time (see instructions in previous constructor).
      To get full credit, make sure to not write code that would be
      redundant with respect to the constructor from task #2

   /* TASK #8 - 1 points
      Write a method that returns a string that represents the information stored
      in the object in a human-readable format.
      For example, if your object holds the following information: 
         name is "Squirrel"
         description is "Action figure, comes from outer space"
         quantity is 253
         unitPrice is 25.99
      Then, the string that your method returns should be:
         "Squirrel: 253 units, $25.99 per unit (Action figure, comes from outer space)"
