/**
   This class models information about an invoice composed of invoice items.
   The code below compiles but is missing critical parts that you need to write. 
   Look for the TASK tags to tell you what you need to write.
   You may work on these tasks in a different order but they are numbered
   so as to provide you with a logical order to follow.
